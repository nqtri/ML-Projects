There are several tasks involved in this project.

First, data need to be scraped from the webpage of the retailer to obtain information for each product offering

Secondly, there is potentially room to build a price monitoring tool for a group of products of interest

Lastly, based on product's features, a similar product recommendation system is built to suggest other items in case a chosen product is sold out
