There are several tasks involved in this project.

First, data need to be scraped from the webpage of the retailer to obtain information for each product offering

Secondly, there is potentially room to build a price monitoring tool for a group of products of interest

Lastly, based on product's features, especially product description and price, a similar product recommendation system is built to suggest other items in case a chosen product is sold out

Another expansion is to make use of the image URLs to train a neural network to recognize products of certain designers.
